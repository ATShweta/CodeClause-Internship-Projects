## Project: Analyze Sentiment in Movie Reviews
<hr/>

> Aim:
The aim of this project is to analyze sentiment in movie reviews by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

> Description:
This project involves using NLP techniques to preprocess text data and build a sentiment analysis model. The goal is to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments based on the content of the reviews. By leveraging libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy, the text data is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a format suitable for model training. The project also explores various machine learning models for sentiment classification and evaluates their performance.

> Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

> Key Features:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Tokenization and text normalization
3. Sentiment analysis model development
4. Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Project: Movie Genre Prediction
<hr/>

> Aim:
The aim of this project is to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary and other features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

> Description:
The "Movie Genre Prediction" project focuses on classifying movies into genres based on their plot summaries and other descriptive features. By employing NLP techniques, the project preprocesses the text data, transforms it into a suitable format, and applies various text classification algorithms to predict the genre of movies. This project is valuable for applications in content recommendation systems and understanding movie content for better user engagement.

> Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NLTK or SpaCy, Scikit-learn

> Key Features:
1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)
2. Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings
3. Genre classification using various machine learning algorithms
4. Model evaluation and optimization

## Project: Customer Segmentation Tool  (Named as Task3)
<hr/>
> Aim:
Develop a UI for users to input customer data and use clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior.

> Description:
This project involves creating a user-friendly interface where users can input customer data. The application uses clustering algorithms like K-Means to segment customers based on their purchase behavior, which can help businesses understand customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. The project combines data preprocessing, clustering, and UI development to provide an end-to-end solution for customer segmentation.

> Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frameworks: Streamlit
 
> Key Features:
1. User interface for data input
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
4. Visualization of clusters
